Automatic detection of a suitable parallel environment is used such that scripts are portable between parallel and non-parallel environments with no modification of the script. Availability and implementation: Source code and binaries freely available (under {GPL}-3) for download via {CRAN} at {http://cran.r-project.org/package=PCIT}, implemented in R and supported on Linux and {MS} Windows.
